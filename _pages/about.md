I am a co-founder and researcher of the [Kyutai](https://kyutai.org/) AI research laboratory. Before that, I was a Staff Research Scientist at Google Brain (now Google Deepmind) where I led the Nouvelle Vague team.
My main contributions include inventing [neural audio codecs](https://research.google/blog/soundstream-an-end-to-end-neural-audio-codec/) which have allowed for the development of [audio language models](https://research.google/blog/audiolm-a-language-modeling-approach-to-audio-generation/) as a framework for audio generation. This in particular led to the first large-scale [text-to-music model](https://blog.google/technology/ai/musiclm-google-ai-test-kitchen/), as well as [speech-to-speech translation with voice preservation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12925). I co-founded Kyutai to create a research environment focused on tackling the most challenging problems without minimal organization overhead and sharing all our discoveries with the research community. I currently focus on multimodal LLMs.
